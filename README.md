# Interactive Quiz Application with Multiple Choice and True/False Questions

## Description:
Developed an interactive quiz application utilizing Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles with C# and Windows Forms (.NET Framework) in Visual Studio to provide an engaging and educational experience for users. The application features two types of questions: Multiple Choice and True/False.

## Key Features:

### Variety of Questions:
* Multiple Choice Questions: Users select the correct answer from a list of options.
* True/False Questions: Users determine the veracity of a statement by choosing either 'True' or 'False.'

### User-Friendly Interface:

* Questions are displayed one at a time using Windows Forms, ensuring a focused and streamlined user experience.
Users are prompted for their answers with intuitive input methods provided by the Windows Forms GUI components.

### Immediate Feedback:

* After each answer submission, users receive instant feedback on the correctness of their response.
This immediate reinforcement helps in learning and retention of information.

### Score Tracking:

* The application maintains a running score, providing users with a summary of their performance at the end of the quiz.
Users can see their total score and percentage of correct answers, allowing them to assess their knowledge and improvement areas.

## Technical Implementation:

* Object-Oriented Design: The quiz application is built using OOP concepts in C#, encapsulating the question types and their behaviors within classes. This modular design enhances code maintainability and scalability.
* Dynamic Question Display: The application dynamically loads and displays questions from a predefined set, ensuring a varied and comprehensive testing experience.
* Answer Validation: Robust mechanisms are implemented to check the correctness of user responses and provide accurate feedback.

## Outcome
The Interactive Quiz Application is a testament to the effective use of OOP principles in creating educational software. It offers an engaging and effective way for users to test and improve their knowledge on various topics, with immediate feedback and comprehensive scoring.
